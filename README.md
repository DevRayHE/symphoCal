## Installation

[Link to this repo url](https://github.com/DevRayHE/symphocal)

[Deployed site on heroku](https://shrouded-woodland-70359.herokuapp.com/)

Follow the steps below to install: 

- On root folder - npm run install to install all development dependancies (Package.json setup to do this for both client and server side automatically)

- To start Server only - navigate to server folder and run npm run start. (Do not use node server.js - as there's a bug was resolved via installing esm npm package to run server via "node -r esm server.js")

- To start development mode locally - on root folder run "npm run develop", will start up server and front end locally on localhost:3000

- Challenges and lessons learnt on Deployment here:
1. Before deployment to Heroku, make sure delete the homepage attributes, such as "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app"
2. To seed data to deployed site on heroku, there's a few approach:
  2a - Step 1 [Try the tips from this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32103222/how-to-seed-data-for-a-nodemongo-app-deployed-to-heroku)
  2b - If following the steps and got a host not found error, do the following:
    2b1: - on the terminal run Heroku Config, copy the generated string
    2b2: - Paste that string to /server/config/connection.js on line 3
    2b:3 - Replact the part: 'mongodb://localhost/symphocal' with the generated string
